## App Engine CMS (Under Construction)

This project is meant to rapidly take users from nothing to a small, free, functioning website.

## The Killer Feature

There are a lot of frameworks and boilerplates that have merit.  The feature that makes this one stand out from the crowd is it's integrated front-end code editor.  That means changes to the the HTML and CSS appear instantly site-wide, as they are typed in the browser.  This provides constant feedback while editing the site.  It is an amazing way to work.
