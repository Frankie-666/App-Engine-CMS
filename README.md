## App Engine CMS (In Progress)

I love Wordpress, but I hate PHP, SQL, and Apache.

Google App Engine CMS is a reimagining of the simple CMS - built fast, flexible, and scalable.

For some developers, this CMS will just save them time they would spend construcing things like pages, posts, users, comments, and a contact form for a simple website.

For other developers, the main benefit of this CMS will be as a best-practices boilerplate - a starting-point to create amazing web experiences with AngularJS, Google App Engine, and diverse APIs.
