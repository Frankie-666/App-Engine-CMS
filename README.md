## Google App Engine CMS (In Progress)

I love Wordpress, but I hate PHP, SQL, and Apache.

App Engine CMS is a reimagining of the simple CMS - built on a modern, flexible, scalable stack.

For some developers, this CMS will just save time they would spend construcing pages, posts, comments, contact forms to make a simple website.  For other developers, the main benefit of this CMS will be as a best-practices boilerplate to begin creating amazing web experiences...with AngularJS and WebApp2, the sky is the limit.
